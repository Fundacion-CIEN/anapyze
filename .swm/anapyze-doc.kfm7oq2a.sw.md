Anapyze is a library that includes different code utilities that I have developed over my years as a neuroimaging data analyst. There are different things inside here:

## <SwmPath>[applePy.py](/applePy.py)</SwmPath>

A utility library that include functions for usual Nifti and Analyze operations.&nbsp;

## <SwmPath>[spm.py](/spm.py)</SwmPath>&nbsp;

Two classes that will allow you to create/run .m files using MATLAB, SPM  and <SwmToken path="/spm.py" pos="11:50:50" line-data="    I have modified this class to make use of matlab instead os SPM standalone. This would allow to more easily update to new SPM/CAT12 versions.">`CAT12`</SwmToken>. This functions can be extremely useful when using cat12 or spm standalone versions.

## pipelines

Inside the pipelines directory, there are several scripts and sets of scripts that conform pipelines for different imaging modalities (sMRI, dMRI, FDG-PET, etc...)
