# anapyze

A bunch of tools for medical (mostly neuro) image processing and statistics that I have crafted over the years.
This is mostly for my personal use, but feel free to look around!!

## What's inside?

- ApplePy.py: A library with basic functions that aims to translate the usefulness of the Fruitcake library from Pablo Aguiar to Python (if you know you know)
- spm.py: A set of functions that aims to simplify working with SPM and big cohorts. There are plenty of other interfaces with great docs but this adapts very well with my workflow.
- /pipelines: Several tools from the previous libraries combined into pipelines for different cohorts
- /scripts: Random useful stuff.
